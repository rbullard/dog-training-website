            <p>
                Hi, I’m Ryan Bullard, the proud owner of Ryan’s K9 Companion. Growing up in NYC, I developed a passion for helping people build stronger relationships with their dogs. Since 2016, I’ve been dedicated to training dogs of all breeds, ages, and temperaments—including puppies, seniors, and those facing challenges like aggression or anxiety.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started my journey as a handler at Fetch Club, a doggy daycare in NYC, and later worked with AKC, gaining invaluable experience with different breeds and dog personalities. These experiences taught me the importance of tailored approaches in training, which I bring to every client.
            </p>

                At Ryan’s K9 Companion, our mission is simple: to empower dog owners with the knowledge and tools they need to bring out the best in their dogs. Dog training isn’t one-size-fits-all—it’s about what’s best for your dog’s unique needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you’re looking to address behavioral challenges or strengthen the bond with your dog, we’re here to help. Let’s work together to create harmony in your home and confidence in your dog. Reach out today to get started!
